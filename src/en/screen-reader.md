title: Screen Reader
---
A screen reader is an assistive technology that translates visual content into audio content or touch content for people with difficulty seeing. 

In the case of screen readers that give audio output, a speech synthesizer alerts the user to such things as text content for the synthesizer to read, the location of the mouse, or the position of the active item on a menu.

Touch output is generated using a refreshable Braille display, which uses rows of cells with changeable Braille characters.

Screen readers often give touch output alongside audio output.
