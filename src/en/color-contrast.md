title: Color Contrast
---

Color contrast describes the contrast between two colors. For a11y purposes, that's generally the contrast between text and a background color (including images with text that are intended to be read); there are also guidelines for [non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html). The most common contrast targets are outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and are AA and AAA, Contrast ['Minimum'](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum) and ['Enhanced'](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced) respectively.

**The purpose of paying attention to color contrast is to ensure that people with moderately low vision can read your content as people with low vision have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with its background.**
