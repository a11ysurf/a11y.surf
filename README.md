# ðŸŒŠ a11y.surf

Welcome to the codebase for [a11y.surf](https://a11y.surf)! **a11y.surf** is a community-sourced online dictionary and reference for web accessibility terms. Our mission is to make it easy to encounter new, unfamiliar web accessibility terms and concepts, and to learn more!

Each **a11y.surf** definition is brief, sitting somewhere between a dictionary definition and a comprehensive encylopedia. We try to provide just enough information to introduce someone to a new idea, and then we provide links to further reading.

**a11y.surf** is built with the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator, and its contents are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Setup

To clone **a11y.surf** for local development, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a11ysurf/a11y.surf.git
cd a11y.surf
```

Next, you'll need to install your dependencies. Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and then, in your `a11y.surf` repository, run:

```
npm install
```

Finally, we'll spin up an Eleventy development server, by running:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will host the site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). As you make changes to the codebase, including adding or modifying definitions, the development server will reload your page, so you can see your changes almost immediately.
